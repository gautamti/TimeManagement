# TimeManagement

People often want to change their schedule to find a better balance between all the things they want to do, 
but in practice it is difficult to make a real change in how you spend your time, that is where our app can help by
●	Allowing the user to easily record what they did throughout the day and how long they spent doing it
●	Allowing the user to look back on previous days to track their schedule over time
●	Setting a goal for themselves and comparing how they spent their time that day to the goal,
allowing them to track their progress towards a long-term change in how they spend their time
